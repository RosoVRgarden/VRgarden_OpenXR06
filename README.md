# VRgarden_OpenXR06
 
This OpenXR template is ready to use on the Oculus Quest and the HTC Vive Pro from a PC (PVCR). It's an update of our previous template that now works with Unity 6. It has examples that demonstrates direct interactables, physical objects (cabinet, door), virtual presence and a lift. 

Requires: Unity 6.0.34 or later with XR Interaction Toolkit 3.0.4 or later.

Thanks to Another Creative Technologist, C-Through, ValemVR for their excellent tutorials.
