# VRgarden_OpenXR06
 
This OpenXR template is ready to use on the Oculus Quest and the HTC Vive Pro from a PC (PVCR). It's the update of our previous template that now works with Unity 6. It has examples that demonstrates direct interactables, psysical objects (cabinet, door), presence and a lift.

Requires: Unity 6.0.34 or later with Interactive Toolkit 3.0.4.

Thanks to Another Creative Technologist, C-Through, ValemVR for their excellent tutorials.
